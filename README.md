## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm TMTimeVR (aka TMTime), a student from Armenia trying to achieve his dreams. I make games, animations and projetcs that get abandoned after a month.

- Fun fact: I suck at coding
- I am currently learning C#
- How to contact me: [The support on my Discord](https://discord.gg/dNzHhASUX7)
