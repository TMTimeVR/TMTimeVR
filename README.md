## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm TMTimeVR (aka TMTime), a student from Armenia trying to achieve his dreams. I make games, animations and projetcs that get abandoned after a month.

- Fun fact: I suck at coding
- I am currently learning C#

## Donations

- Another fun fact: I'm broke and need money to fund my projetcs.

Here's all my stuff I have to pay for:

- 190â‚¬ for multiplayer servers (yearly right now)

- 12â‚¬ for PlayFab (monthly)

- 11â‚¬ My VPS (for websites other misc projetcs, monthly)

- ~100â‚¬ for commisions and other misc stuff (yearly)

# That adds up to:

**566â‚¬** (yearly)
